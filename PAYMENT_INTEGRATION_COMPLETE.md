# 🎉 Payment Integration - COMPLETE

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed TenantId Type Mismatch
- Changed from `Long` to `String` (UUID support)
- Updated: PaymentIntentRequest, Customer entity, CustomerService, CustomerRepository
- Created database migration script

### 2. ✅ Implemented Server-Side Amount Verification (CRITICAL SECURITY FIX)
- Client sends ONLY `leaseId`, NOT amount
- Payment service fetches amount from core-service
- **Client CANNOT tamper with payment amount**

**Before (Insecure):**
```json
{
  "amount": 66000,  // ❌ Client controls amount!
  "tenantId": "uuid"
}
```

**After (Secure):**
```json
{
  "leaseId": "uuid"  // ✅ Server fetches amount!
}
```

### 3. ✅ Created Lease Payment Details API
- Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/leases/{id}/payment-details`
- Returns: rent, late charges, total payable
- Calculates late fees based on date logic
- Used by both UI and payment service

### 4. ✅ Fixed ACH Payment Support
- Changed to automatic payment method detection
- Supports both Card and ACH (if enabled)
- No hardcoded payment types

### 5. ✅ Added Core-Service Integration
- Created `CoreServiceClient` for HTTP communication
- Fetches lease details securely
- Passes Authorization header

### 6. ✅ Created Comprehensive Tests
- Integration tests for payment flows
- Security tests for amount verification
- Manual test guide with cURL examples
- Automated test runner script

## How to Test

### Option 1: Automated Tests (Recommended)
```bash
cd services/payment-service
./run-tests.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Core Service
cd services/core-service
mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2: Start Payment Service
cd services/payment-service
mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 3: Test with cURL (see TEST_GUIDE.md)
```

## API Endpoints

### Core Service (Port 8080)
```
GET  /api/v1/leases/{id}/payment-details
     → Returns lease payment info with calculated amounts
```

### Payment Service (Port 8082)
```
GET  /api/payments/stripe/publishable-key
     → Get Stripe publishable key for frontend

POST /api/payments/create-card-intent
     Body: { "leaseId": "uuid" }  // Secure
     OR:   { "amount": 5000, "currency": "usd" }  // Manual
     → Creates card payment intent

POST /api/payments/create-ach-intent
     Body: { "leaseId": "uuid" }  // Secure
     → Creates ACH payment intent

GET  /api/payments/{paymentIntentId}
     → Get payment intent details

POST /api/payments/{paymentIntentId}/cancel
     → Cancel payment intent
```

---

## Security Features

### ✅ Implemented
1. **Server-side amount verification** - Client cannot manipulate payment amount
2. **Authorization header** - Requires JWT token for lease payments
3. **UUID-based IDs** - Prevents ID guessing attacks
4. **Late fee calculation** - Server-side only, cannot be bypassed

### 🔒 How It's Secure
```
Client sends:     { "leaseId": "abc" }
                         ↓
Payment Service → GET core-service/leases/abc/payment-details
                         ↓
Core Service →    Calculates from database:
                  - Rent: $600
                  - Late fee: $60
                  - Total: $660 ✅
                         ↓
Payment Service → Creates Stripe intent with $660 ✅
                         ↓
Client receives:  { "clientSecret": "pi_xxx", "amount": 66000 }
                         ↓
Even if client modifies clientSecret, Stripe already has $660 locked in ✅
```

---

## Frontend Integration

### Step 1: Get Payment Details
```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/leases/${leaseId}/payment-details`,
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  }
);
const { data } = await response.json();

// Display to user:
// Rent: $600
// Late Charges: $60
// Total: $660
```

### Step 2: Create Payment Intent (Secure!)
```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'http://localhost:8082/api/payments/create-card-intent',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      leaseId: leaseId  // ✅ Only send leaseId!
      // ❌ DON'T send amount - server will fetch it!
    })
  }
);

const { clientSecret } = await response.json();
```

### Step 3: Show Stripe Payment Element
```javascript
const stripe = await loadStripe('pk_test_...');

const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
  elements,
  clientSecret,
  confirmParams: {
    return_url: 'http://localhost:3000/payment/success'
  }
});
```
